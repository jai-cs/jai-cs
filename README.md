### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

*It's me, Jai Shah !*

<p>I am a tech-nerd and probably spend way too much time on a digital device during my day. I see each and every digital aspect of the society from a developer's lens to understand how the code behind anything was written.</p>
<p>Not a language learning bookworm but a logical thinker and problem solver. I like to focus more on the "syntax" that takes me to the "output" than the "output" itself. !</p>

<p>
Here's some stuff about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Python based face detection web app](https://github.com/jai-cs/Face-Mask-Detection).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter Development to make mobile applications.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on twitter.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can speak 4 languages (English, Hindi, Arabic & Gujarati) !
