### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

*It's me, Jai Shah !*

<p>I am a technerd and probably spend way too much time on a digital device during my day. I see each and every digital aspect of the society from a developer's lens to understand how the code behind anything was written.</p>
<p>Not a language learning bookworm but a logical thinker and problem solver. I like to focus more on the "output" of the problem than the "syntax" that takes me there !</p>
